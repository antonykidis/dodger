# Dodger
I wanted to start praticing to code games, but I was having problems having ideias for simples games, so I found this article online ["I Need Practice Programming": 49 Ideas for Game Clones to Code](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2012/02/20/i-need-practice-programming-49-ideas-for-game-clones-to-code/) and then I started coding Dodger with C# and Monogame.
